gMaxLinkedï¼Œa framework or a backend application for large concurrency, real-time, long-live tcp applications. 

You can use gMaxLinked to establish application used by android push, WeChat/Line backend server, etc.  You can find the source code in src folder.

There are C and Java code for corresponding clients reference, you can find them in client folder.  You can use C and Java code directly, they have been tested with gMaxLinked as a server. 

gMaxLinked only work on linux 64-bit.

Following libs is necessary for gMaxLinked:
> pthread
> hiredis
> log4c

Now maybe the whole project doesn't work well.  I will make it work well later, I mean after I finished my company's products development, which is based on gMaxLinked.
