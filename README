gMaxLinkedï¼Œa framework or a backend application for large concurrency, real-time, long-live tcp applications. 

You can use gMaxLinked to establish application used by android push, WeChat/Line backend server, etc.  You can find the source code in src folder.

There are C and Java code for corresponding clients reference, you can find them in client folder.  You cannot use them directly, you have to adapt them for your project. 

gMaxLinked only work on linux 64-bit.

Following libs is necessary for gMaxLinked:
> pthread

Now the whole project doesn't work now.  I will make it work later, I mean after I finished my company's products development, which is based on gMaxLinked.
